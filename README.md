# Super-Space-Invaders-
Made with Javascript.

This project is still under development, but here is how it is so far!


The waves was just set up quickly, so it is not how i twill be in the final version.
All stats (for example, Bullet damage + speed, Enemy health + speed, Player speed, etc.), Will be corrected later on. 
For now im more busy with the functionality, rather than the polish.

The game sounds will also probably change, and made so that one sound isn't too loud compared to the rest, and vice versa.

If you want to test the game so far, download or clone. You will need a localhost to run this game. 
I recommend using Live Server, a VSCode extension. Just go to the extension tab, type "Live Server".
The first option that appears should be the one i am using, the one with the purple Signal icon.

When done installing, go to the lower left of the IDE. One of the options should be "Go Live".
Click it. It should automatically open a browser window for you to play the game!

Note, i have not cleaned the code yet, and there is no comments to help.


Game Controls:

WASD to move
Space to shoot


Game Mechanics:

  Like most newer version of a Galactic Game, all you do is shoot down the incomming enemies.

  Bullets:
  
  You have three types of bullets, blue, green, and purple (for now). 
  Blue is just a normal bullet, nothing special. Low damage, medium speed.
  Green works a bit different. The green bullet goes right through the enemy, dealing a small amount of damage every frame. Slowest of the bullets.
  Purple has the most damage and is most powerfull. Quick and destructive.

  Enemies:

  All enemies has a different kind of special attack or ability or movement pattern, except the pink one.
  You will soon realize what it is. For now, all enemies has the same amount of HP, except pink has less. That will be changed soon.
  There is just 5 enemies for now. I hope to add more soon.

  Bosses:

  There is Four bosses. Each of the bosses has a regular attack, but each has two special abilities. (Just two for now. Will probably change later on)
  You will have to find out for yourself what their abilities are :).

  Misc:

  If you get destroyed, you lose a live, but all enemies on the screen get destroyed (except bosses)
  You just lose a live when an enemy slips past you.

  Look out for the HP Powerup. It might save you!

If you don't like the music, or it irritates you, or it's too loud, just go to main.js line 164 (This might change!) and set the volume to 0.

Let's see who can tell me what the bosses abilities are!
If you want to, you can give me the answer on discord to _alexei2

Have fun playing!
